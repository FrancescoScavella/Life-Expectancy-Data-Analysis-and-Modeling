# Movies_Project

In this project, we built a machine learning model to predict the average life expectancy of a country based on data collected from the World Health Organization, and we analyzed the correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy.

Specifically, starting from the dataset, we applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and tested two models (XGBRegressor and Random Forest). We then optimized the hyperparameters of both models using a Random Search method, achieving a high level of accuracy. To prevent overfitting, cross-validation was performed.
